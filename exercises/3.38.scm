;;a) The possible values are (50, 45, 40, 35)

;;b) You get a lot more possible values.
;; The most basic ones are like 55 from p2 setting between p1 acessing and setting
;; and 40 from p1 and p2 being switched in that scenario. The biggest factor
;; into the large increase in extra possibilities is that p3 accesses balance
;; twice. At any point balance can be set between those 2 by any previously
;; discussed scenarios giving you new values like 60 and 80.
